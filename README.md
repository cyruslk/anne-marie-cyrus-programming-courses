------



1. From a string, return the first letter only. If another parameter is passed, return `undefined`. 

2. From a string, return the last letter only. If another parameter is passed, return `undefined`. 

3. From a string, return only the letter located at position `2`. If the word length is too short for this program, return the following log: `Please enter a longer word.`

4. From a string, return only letters located at position `2` and position `4`. If the word length is too short for this program, return the following log: `Please enter a longer word.`

5. From a string, return the same string with first and last letters removed. If, for an example, I'm passing to the program the following string: `Hello`, the program should return me `ello`.   If the word length is too short for this program, return the following log: `Please enter a longer word`. 

6. From a string, return the same string with the letter located at position `5` removed.

7. From a string, return only the even letters. If the word is `Hello world`, the returned string should be someting like `Hlowl`. 

8. From a string, return a new version of this string where each letters would be outputted twice. If the word is `Hello world`, the returned string should be something like `HHeelloo  wwoorrlldd`

9. From a string, return its reversed version. If the word if `Hello`, the returned word should be `olleH`.
