## AS A WARM UP...

1. From a string, return an array of letters. 
2. From an array, return a string.
3. If a number is passed into a function that accepts only strings or arrays, return something like `sorry, wrong parameter`.

------



1. From a string, return the first letter only. If another parameter is passed, return `undefined`. 

2. From a string, return the last letter only. If another parameter is passed, return `undefined`. 

3. From a string, return only the letter located at position `2`. If the word length is too short for this program, return the following log: `Please enter a longer word.`

4. From a string, return only letters located at position `2` and at position `5`.  If the word length is too short for this program, return the following log: `Please enter a longer word.`

5. From a string, return the same string with first and last letters removed. If, for an example, I'm passing to the program the following string: `Hello`, the program should return me `ello`.   If the word length is too short for this program, return the following log: `Please enter a longer word`. 

6. From a string, return the same string with the letter located at position `5` removed.

7. From a string, return only the even letters. If the word is `Hello world`, the returned string should be someting like `Hlowl`. 

8. From a string, return a new version of this string where each letters would be outputted twice. If the word is `Hello world`, the returned string should be something like `HHeelloo  wwoorrlldd`

9. From a string, return its reversed version. If the word if `Hello`, the returned word should be `olleH`.

1. Using the ` map()` method:
   1. recreate: 8
   2. recreate: 9
2. Using the `filter() ` method:
   1. recreate: 6
   2. recreate: 7 
3. Using both `filter()` and `map()` together:
   1. Return the even strings of all the numbers located in this following string: `hell1234o w5678orl90d`. 
4. Using a simple `for()` loop, return the sum of the following array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];`
5. Same exercise using a `map()` method.
6. Using both `filter()` and `map()` method,  return the sum of the following array of numbers except the numbers located at position `0` and `3`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];`
7. Using both `filter()` and `map()` method,  return the sum of the following array of numbers except the numbers located at position `0` and `3`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];`
8. Using both `filter()` and `map()` method,  return the sum of numbers located in this following string: `hell1234o w5678orl90d`. 
9. Using both `reduce()`,  return the sum of the following array of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`;
10. Using `map() `and `reduce()`,  return the sum of numbers located in this following string: `hell1234o w5678orl90d`.
